# shadcn/ui monorepo template

This is a TanStack Start monorepo template with shadcn/ui.

## Adding components

To add components to your app, run the following command at the root of your `company-profile` app:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button -c apps/company-profile
```

This will place the ui components in the `packages/ui/src/components` directory.

## Using components

To use the components in your app, import them from the `ui` package.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@repo/ui/components/button";
```
